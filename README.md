# mailsender

Application written in 2010 for bulk emailing using HTML templates. Freemarker is used to add variables to the HTML template. 


Requires:

https://github.com/OpenIndex/OpenIndex-SHEF

This currently needs to be cloned and installed locally, as it doesnt exist in the public maven repository.

TODO
- currently a few files / libraries are missing and so no longer works. The application needs to be updated.
